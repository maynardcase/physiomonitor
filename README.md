# physiomonitor

Children with cystic fibrosis generally have to do physio, which takes many forms. This is a script to help make physio more interesting and more fun for children who use a Pari Pep S tube for blowing exercises. 

This is currently aimed at people who do a number of sets of blowing interspersed with huffs. The current hard-coded configuration involves three sides, each consisting of six sets of twelve blows. 

It requires the following hardware components:
* A Raspberry PI
* A Pimoroni Unicorn HAT 
* A USB microphone
* A binder clip
* A Pari Pep S
